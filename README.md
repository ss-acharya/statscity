# statscity

The scripts in this repo take in sample data from a laboratory in the form of a .csv file and outputs a word document with all the data processed, tabulated and formatted according the customer specifications. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Background

Water, in it's raw form, has many pollutants in it. County Public Utility Districts try to keep track of all the pollutants in them by creating daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports. The scripts listed are created to do just that. 

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Problem / Question

Pollutants in water need to be regularly reported to the relevant client. As such, there needs to be a way to instantaneously generate the reports given the data for the given client. That is the purpose of the created scripts.
