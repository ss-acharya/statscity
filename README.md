# statscity

This is the repo where the initial scripts of my project with the City of San Diego PUD-LIMS are stored.Â 

The scripts in this repo take in sample data from a laboratory in the form of a .csv file and outputs a word document with all the data processed, tabulated and formatted according the customer specifications.
