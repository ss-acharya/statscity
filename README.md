The scripts in this repo take in sample data from a laboratory in the form of a .csv file and outputs a word document with all the data processed, tabulated and formatted according the customer specifications. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Background

Water, in it's raw form, has many pollutants in it. County Public Utility Districts try to keep track of all the pollutants in them by creating daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports. The scripts listed are created to do just that. 

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Problem / Question

Pollutants in water need to be regularly reported to the relevant client. As such, there needs to be a way to instantaneously generate the reports given the data for the given client. That is the purpose of the created scripts. 


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Methods

The method for this was that I used the language R to write the scripts that take the data in so as to start the report creation. I also use the package flextable (in R) as well as R programming so as to create the best of processing to data for reporting and outputting at as a functional report.

## Results

It does the job that it is intended to do - create a simple, yet palatable report for a given customer who asks for it.
